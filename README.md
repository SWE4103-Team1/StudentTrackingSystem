# Student Tracking System
## 10.19-update
Now our repo has successfully deployed Django CI through Github Action!
- This will automatically run Django Test when you push or merge and return a result to tell you whether your project successfully ran this test.
- If you get a failed result, click the **Action** button to view the log.
- This branch is merged from the **dev** branch because this is the latest branch after sprint1.
********
## fetch, push & merge
For coding, please
- choose one dev branch from the lists
- create one new branch, like feature_Tom
- checkout to your branch and code
- commit and push to your branch
- merge your branch into the latest dev branch and delete your feature branch
******
## differnences between dev and feature
- **choose feature_xxxx** just for checkouting from dev_*** and ***delete*** it after merging
- **choose dev_xxxx** for merging your code with others and **delete your feature** branch after that
- delete old dev if you all are working on new dev
*******
## main
After completing all development of a phase
- merge all dev branches into the main branch
- update the version number, like STS 1.0
- delete all feature branches
- write a document for this version
